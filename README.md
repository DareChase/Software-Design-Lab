## Course Description

Many digital humanities projects require the creation of software, and many of these projects are large, complex, or require sustained collaboration. Knowledge of particular methods, processes, and tools is necessary for completion and maintenance of significant projects in the digital humanities. This course will give students a foundation in software development methodologies that they can draw from throughout their coursework and career.
 
This is a technical course, and students will learn a variety of hard and soft skills important for successful project completion. These include a limited number of fundamental concepts in programming, the use of version control, common software design patterns, managing state and persistence, and the basics of test driven development (TDD). The course will focus on two software "stacks," or collections of systems and tools frequently used alongside one another: a WordPress stack less focused on writing code, and a flexible stack based on coding in the Python programming language. Broader topics of discussion will include working to specifications, time line estimation, formulating an MVP, using project management tools, reading documentation, building for maintainability, and software ethics. After completing this course, students will be able to evaluate tradeoffs in software design, collaborate in a small group of mixed skills, and implement the most common techniques for designing modern software.

## Patrick's Technical Philosophy


It's All Just Text  
Boring Is Better  
Everything Old Is New Again  
Simple, Not Easy  
Build from Small Pieces  
Practice, but Practice  
Our Greatest Foe, Complexity  

## Accessibility and Accomodations

If a reasonable accommodation by myself or the Graduate Center would help you to achieve your goals for this course, you may either approach me for a discussion of possible accommodations or speak with the Graduate Center's [Disability Services Office](https://gc.cuny.edu/Prospective-Current-Students/Current-Students/Disability-Services). You can connect with Disability Services staff by emailing disabilityservices@gc.cuny.edu. Universal access is a critical part of my pedagogy, and I am always willing to discuss accessibility improvements, whether or not the discussion is predicated on a formal recognition of a disability by the university.

## Schedule

Week One

### Discussion: Design Philosophies

In software design, the most difficult problem is not in coding, but in planning, organizing, and completing software projects that match to concerns in the real-world. This week, we will compare prevalent design philosophies, including "waterfall" and "agile," and ask what we can learn from industry software development to apply in a digital humanities context.

### Lab: Python I 

Our first session on the Python programming language will include these topics:

Using the REPL  
Data types  
Variables  
Running Python scripts

### Discussion: Accessibility

Accessibility is the quality of objects, interfaces, and information that determines their availability to a broad variety of human experiences. If software is inaccessible, it may only be usable by a narrow band of humanity. Since an overwhelming majority of software developers are young and able (also white, economically advantaged, and male), considerations such as users with alternate cognitive, sensory, and mobility needs or infrastructural inequality are considered an afterthought. This week, we will discuss access in software design and specifically the web, including consideration of semantics, fallbacks, and "simple vs. easy" in software design.

### Lab: HTML/CSS

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a way to meaningfully describe documents and their various elements in plain text for representation on the web. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language for describing how HTML documents should be presented to users. In this session, we will

### Discussion: A Practical History of the Web

In the beginning, there was HTML. Web pages were documents that connected to other documents, and were created by hand-writing HTML. Later, in the Golden Age of Blogging, content management systems like WordPress rose to popularity by providing database-powered software to dynamically generate HTML whenever a visitor requested a page. Today, tools like Jekyll provide a third path that provide advantages over CMS in specific situations. 

Also, Javascript. And web apps. And frontend frameworks. How does all this stuff fit together?

This discussion will describe web tecnology in 2018 by tracing some history and taking note of major concepts and movements.

### Lab: Static sites with Jekyll

Static site generators provide a way to build a website that has modern functionality—blogging, RSS, templating, markdown—without the overhead of a database. While certain features, such as comment sections, are difficult to implement on a static site, static sites have many advantages: they are more maintainable, simpler to understand and modify, are difficult to hack, and are more archivable and sustainable. They also fit neatly into a content management workflow that includes the command line, a text editor, Git, and markdown.
