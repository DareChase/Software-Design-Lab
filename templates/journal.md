# Darren's Technical Journal

## The week following Class 1 (1/30-2/6)

In the first class, I didn’t have a laptop of my own, so I just watched the command line on another student’s laptop and took notes listing the steps taken. So, the week after class I installed git bash onto my Windows laptop at home which went successfully. My home laptop is big, so I don’t want to carry it around, and I’m thinking of finding a smaller MacBook to use in class instead. In the meantime, I try repeating the Command Line activities which were shown in class. The basic commends we covered seem to work so far. Next, I needed to clone Patrick’s repository into my project file. I went back to the Command Line in Windows and for some reason “mkdir” wasn’t working. The note was saying the syntax was wrong, or it couldn’t find the path. Later I did Command Line tutorials which were present the labs to see if I could figure things out more.

I ended up going to Best Buy and used the display of MacBooks to practice finding and using Command Line on them to see how it worked there as opposed to Windows. I felt like it would be better to use a Mac because I believe Patrick mentioned that Windows didn’t have a true UNIX. Since I couldn’t get the Git Bash to work correctly on my laptop, I tried creating my own repository from the account I created on github. I created the repository but couldn’t figure out how I would add content to it but read through help topics on the website. Also, I did more lab tutorials.

I realized we had readings to do, too. I found “Decoding Liberation” at Bronx Community College’s library, where I work, so I could carry that with me to read on the subway. Then Patrick created a dropbox where I could print out “Design for Designers.”

I don’t know specifically how much time I spent on each activity. I spent a couple hours installing git bash and learning aspects of the github website’s uses. I, also, spent a couple hours learning and getting familiar with Command Line using Windows and a MacBook. I spent time reading open software and design, although reading isn’t a technical activity, but it’s related

## The week following Class 2 (2/6-2/13)

I couldn’t make it to class 2 but continued to figure out what we covered so far. I finally got a hold of a MacBook. I went through the process of adding git bash again and the Command Line ended up working correctly with this laptop. The “mkdir” command worked fine and I was able to create the projects folder. So, I was glad I could finally clone the repository. In class they had cloned Patrick’s repository link, so that is what I did, and it worked. So, I now had two titled repositories on my github page. I couldn’t how to delete the blank one I had created, but I found the way to change a repository’s title. I changed the title to “blank.” So, I had the copy of Patrick’s repository there, but I couldn’t figure out how to update the “goals” and “journal.”

I saw that the class I missed was covering Plain Text. I decided to do the Plain Text lab tutorials. I read about Plain Text and Markdown and followed the labs where the use of Visual Code was brought up. I attempted to add the Visual Code which was added within one of the tutorials. I don’t know if I was using it correctly and wanted another human being to explain things to me instead of just reading a lab. I figured I would wait until class 3. In the meantime, I saw that we are doing python in the next class, so I decided to add Anaconda which was necessary before class. I searched the web to look at different suggestions on how to add it and ended up getting the latest version added.

Again, I don’t know specifically how many hours were spent on technical aspects. Since, acquiring the MacBook, I spent time again reviewing Command Line and Git Bash. Also, I was still spending time trying to figure how the github website works and what it can do. Plus, time was spent with learning about and how to use Plain Text and Visual Code. There was time spent learning about and installing Anaconda.

## The week following Class 3 (2/13-2/20)

Directly after class 3 I was able to sit with Patrick to review what I missed from class 2. I had cloned Patrick’s repository but needed to use the link from my github page, so I changed that. Then I found out how to delete repositories from my site, so I could get rid of “blank” and the clone which used Patrick’s link. Patrick also showed how to push the “goals” from my directory to github. This was what I had been wondering about. But later, at home, when I tried to push an update, it wasn’t working. For a few days I kept watching videos on pushing files to github. The videos were from the github website and continued onto miscellaneous youtube videos. I got frustrated and just added changes to my “goals” directly from the github website because I wanted it done. For the update for the “journal” I thought I would wait until I figured out the problem or got help in the next class.

In the meantime. I spent time repeating the work with Visual Code and Python that we covered in class. It turns out I hadn’t installed the Visual Code, or maybe what I did wasn’t right but the assistant in class installed the Visual Code we would be using for me. So, at home I practiced the visual code example we did in class. I did Python labs which were in the repository. I also went over the Python examples we did in class because some things didn’t work in class. I couldn’t keep up with all the input information. I can take my time at home.

I read and listened to “Dear Developer, the Web isn’t about You,” “Two Bit History: The World Wide Web and it’s Inventor.” Also, I read “A Web for Everyone” after I notice that Patrick added it the the dropbox.

## The week following Class 4 (2/20-2/27)

I stayed late again after class 4 because I needed to figure out why I couldn’t push updated files to github. It turns out that the changes I made directly on the website made the directory on my laptop different from what was on github. This meant I had to merge the two files by pulling them, making the changes, and then I could push them.
